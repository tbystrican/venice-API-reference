# Bug Report: Missing "Preview" Tag Definition

## Summary
The "Preview" tag was used in operation definitions but not defined in the global tags section, causing linting warnings and violating OpenAPI best practices.

## Bug Details

**File:** `venice.openapi.v3.yaml`  
**Lines:** 3925, 4054  
**Severity:** Medium (causes warnings, but not errors)  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

## Description

The Venice.ai OpenAPI specification referenced a "Preview" tag in two endpoint operations:
1. `/api/v1/characters` (GET) - line 3925
2. `/api/v1/characters/{slug}` (GET) - line 4054

However, this tag was not defined in the global `tags` section of the specification (lines 47-78). According to OpenAPI 3.0.0 best practices, all tags used in operations should be defined globally with descriptions.

## Impact

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Linting tools (Spectral) generated warnings about undefined tags
- ❌ Documentation tools might not properly display or group these endpoints
- ❌ Violated OpenAPI best practices
- ❌ Made the specification less maintainable

### After Fix:
- ✅ All linting warnings related to tag definitions resolved
- ✅ Documentation tools can properly categorize preview/experimental endpoints
- ✅ Follows OpenAPI 3.0.0 standards and conventions
- ✅ Clear indication that these are beta/experimental features

## Root Cause

When the Characters endpoints were added or updated, they were tagged with "Preview" to indicate their experimental nature. However, the corresponding tag definition was not added to the global tags section, likely due to oversight during development.

## Fix Implementation

### Location
File: `venice.openapi.v3.yaml`  
Section: `tags` (after line 78)

### Change Made
Added the following tag definition:

```yaml
  - description: |
      Preview endpoints that are in beta or experimental stages. These features
      may change or be removed in future versions. Use with caution in production.
    name: Preview
```

### Why This Fix Works
1. **Defines the tag globally**: Makes it available for use in any operation
2. **Provides context**: The description clearly indicates these are experimental features
3. **Follows conventions**: Matches the style and structure of other tag definitions
4. **Resolves warnings**: Eliminates linting warnings about undefined tags

## Verification

### Test Case: `test_preview_tag_bug.py`

A dedicated test was created to verify this bug fix:

```bash
python3 test_preview_tag_bug.py
```

**Test Logic:**
1. Loads the OpenAPI specification
2. Extracts all globally defined tags
3. Extracts all tags used in operations
4. Verifies that all used tags (including "Preview") are defined globally
5. Validates that the Preview tag has a proper description

**Before Fix:** Test would FAIL - Preview tag used but not defined  
**After Fix:** Test PASSES - Preview tag properly defined with description

### Automated Test Suite

The comprehensive test suite (`test_openapi_spec.py`) also validates this:

```bash
python3 test_openapi_spec.py
# or
npm test
```

The "Tag Definitions" test now shows:
```
✓ All 10 used tags are properly defined
```

### Linting Validation

Running the lint script confirms the fix:

```bash
./lint.sh
```

**Before Fix:** 5 warnings including tag definition issues  
**After Fix:** 3 warnings (only unrelated schema validation warnings remain)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Tag Management**: Always define tags globally before using them in operations
2. **Code Review**: Tag additions/changes should include corresponding global definitions
3. **Automated Testing**: Test suite now catches this type of issue automatically
4. **Documentation**: Preview/experimental features should be clearly marked

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues:

1. ✅ **Automated Tests**: `test_openapi_spec.py` now validates tag consistency
2. ✅ **Linting**: Regular linting catches undefined tags
3. ✅ **Documentation**: CONTRIBUTING.md includes guidelines for adding tags
4. ✅ **Pre-commit Checks**: Developers should run `./lint.sh` before committing
